# Healthcare & Finance AI – National Impact Projects

## About Me
I am a Data and AI Engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, focused on building applied machine learning solutions for healthcare and financial security systems.

## Research and Project Focus
- Predictive healthcare analytics
- Disease risk prediction models
- Financial fraud detection systems
- Explainable and ethical AI solutions
- Scalable data-driven decision systems

## Why Healthcare and Finance AI?
Healthcare and financial systems are critical pillars of the United States economy and public well-being.
I focus on applying machine learning to improve early disease detection, reduce preventable healthcare costs,
and strengthen financial fraud detection mechanisms.

## National Interest Statement
My work aims to contribute to the U.S. national interest by:
- Improving healthcare outcomes through predictive analytics
- Reducing economic loss caused by preventable diseases
- Enhancing financial security through intelligent fraud detection
- Supporting data-driven decision-making in critical systems

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial analysis was conducted to understand patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.
Target distribution analysis highlights the importance of early risk detection to support preventive healthcare decision-making.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Preparation

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing structured feature sets for predictive modeling.
These steps are critical for building reliable and interpretable healthcare AI systems.

### Baseline Predictive Model

A logistic regression model was trained as a baseline to predict heart disease risk.
Evaluation metrics highlight the model’s ability to identify at-risk patients, emphasizing recall to minimize missed diagnoses.
This establishes a foundation for more advanced healthcare AI models.

### Advanced Predictive Models

Advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest, were trained to improve disease risk detection.
These models demonstrated enhanced recall performance, reducing the likelihood of missed diagnoses and supporting preventive healthcare interventions.

### Explainable AI and Transparency

Explainable AI techniques were applied using permutation-based SHAP to interpret disease risk predictions from the Random Forest model.
This approach improves transparency, trust, and ethical deployment of AI in healthcare systems.


## Project Summary
This project focuses on developing an explainable machine learning system to predict heart disease risk using patient health indicators. The system leverages structured clinical data and advanced ensemble models to support early disease detection. By prioritizing recall and transparency, the project aims to reduce missed diagnoses and assist preventive healthcare decision-making in the United States.

## Problem Addressed
Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States. Many cases are diagnosed late due to limited early risk assessment tools, leading to preventable complications and increased healthcare costs. There is a national need for data-driven, transparent, and reliable decision-support systems that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients earlier.

## Proposed Solution
An end-to-end machine learning pipeline was developed, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability. A Random Forest classifier was selected for its ability to model non-linear clinical relationships. Model performance was evaluated with an emphasis on recall to minimize missed disease cases. Explainable AI techniques were applied to ensure transparency and clinical interpretability.

## Key Results

- Baseline logistic regression achieved a disease-class recall of 91%
- An advanced Random Forest model improved disease-class recall to 97%
- Explainable AI analysis identified clinically meaningful features such as chest pain type, vascular indicators, and exercise-related metrics as key contributors

These results demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in identifying high-risk patients while maintaining interpretability.

## Explainable AI and Ethical Considerations
Explainable AI techniques were applied using SHAP to interpret model predictions. Feature-level explanations aligned with established clinical risk factors, improving transparency and trust. This approach supports ethical AI deployment by enabling healthcare professionals to understand, validate, and responsibly use model outputs.

## National Importance and Public Benefit
Early identification of cardiovascular risk can reduce emergency hospitalizations, lower long-term treatment costs, and improve patient outcomes. Transparent AI-driven risk assessment tools support preventive healthcare initiatives and align with U.S. public health priorities. This work contributes to national efforts to improve healthcare efficiency, quality, and accessibility.

## Petitioner’s Qualifications
The petitioner holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering and has hands-on experience in applied machine learning, data engineering, and explainable AI. The project demonstrates the petitioner’s ability to independently design, implement, evaluate, and interpret complex AI systems aligned with real-world healthcare needs.

## Benefit of Waiving Labor Certification
The work demonstrated in this project is independent, research-driven, and focused on public benefit rather than employer-specific objectives. Waiving the labor certification requirement would allow the petitioner to continue advancing healthcare-focused AI solutions that serve national interests without delay or restriction.
