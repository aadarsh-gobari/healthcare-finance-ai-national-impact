# Healthcare & Finance AI – National Impact Projects

## About Me
I am a Data and AI Engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, focused on building applied machine learning solutions for healthcare and financial security systems.

## Research and Project Focus
- Predictive healthcare analytics
- Disease risk prediction models
- Financial fraud detection systems
- Explainable and ethical AI solutions
- Scalable data-driven decision systems

## Why Healthcare and Finance AI?
Healthcare and financial systems are critical pillars of the United States economy and public well-being.
I focus on applying machine learning to improve early disease detection, reduce preventable healthcare costs,
and strengthen financial fraud detection mechanisms.

## National Interest Statement
My work aims to contribute to the U.S. national interest by:
- Improving healthcare outcomes through predictive analytics
- Reducing economic loss caused by preventable diseases
- Enhancing financial security through intelligent fraud detection
- Supporting data-driven decision-making in critical systems

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial analysis was conducted to understand patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.
Target distribution analysis highlights the importance of early risk detection to support preventive healthcare decision-making.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Preparation

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing structured feature sets for predictive modeling.
These steps are critical for building reliable and interpretable healthcare AI systems.

### Baseline Predictive Model

A logistic regression model was trained as a baseline to predict heart disease risk.
Evaluation metrics highlight the model’s ability to identify at-risk patients, emphasizing recall to minimize missed diagnoses.
This establishes a foundation for more advanced healthcare AI models.

### Advanced Predictive Models

Advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest, were trained to improve disease risk detection.
These models demonstrated enhanced recall performance, reducing the likelihood of missed diagnoses and supporting preventive healthcare interventions.
